# git-commands

This repository contains a .txt file with useful git commands and their sources

I created 'git.txt' using this prompt and an AI code editor:

    'In this text file, add every git command and definition alphabetically from the provided text. The format should be 'x. git <command>: <definition>', where x is a number marking the order of the command in this section, <command> is the syntax of the command e.g. git branch, git reset, and <definition> is a short description of the command. Add a header to this new section, and add a suitable title to this file.'

I maintain 'git.txt' using this prompt and an AI code editor:

    'In this text file, add every git command and definition alphabetically from the provided text . The format should be 'x. git <command>: <definition>', where x is a number marking the order of the command in this section, <command> is the syntax of the command e.g. git branch, git reset, and <definition> is a short description of the command. Add a header to this new section, and arrange this section alphabetically with previous section(s).'
